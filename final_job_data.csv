Project and Development Services

What this job involves:

Pillar of the team

Working closely with either the project manager or the senior project manager (or both), you’ll play a pivotal role in driving project success. You’ll take ownership of small projects, and provide a boost to the major ones. Being one of the leaders at the helm, you’ll explore ways to bring out the best in your team by walking the talk when it comes to ensuring optimal outcomes for all stakeholders. Likewise, you’re in charge of the organisational structure for each project, making sure that all reporting, communication and working procedures are streamlined, and that every project has clear objectives in place.

Additionally, you’ll help drive the effective use of JLL technology, which includes Project Home Page (PHP), Prolog and Atlas. And if you have excellent budget management skills, you’re perfect for this job! As this role needs someone who is good at forecast expenditure project and, most important, ensure that each process is within reasonable cost.

Building strong client relationships

We live and breathe client satisfaction. Thus, we need someone who share the same passion and dedication. You’ll maintain a strong and positive relationship with our clients by identifying their needs, requirements and constraints.

Of course, as you represent our clients’ best interests, you’ll also keep in mind JLL’s own business needs—and, thereby, strive to achieve an ideal balance between the two. You’ll do so by being on the lookout for opportunities to introduce potential prospects to other business lines at JLL and build relationships with clients. You’ll also see to it that project revenue and payment cycles are properly managed to avoid bad debt.

Upholding excellence in project delivery

For over 200 years, JLL has become synonymous with project success—you will help continue this history of excellence. You’ll manage professional consultants necessary for the design and documentation of the project, as well as carry out contract administration of all vendors professionally and in accordance with legal requirements to protect commercial interests of client and JLL. You will also help identify project risks and implement measures to mitigate them. Furthermore, you will create project-related reports, analyses and reviews.

Sound like you? To apply you need to be:

An expert in the field

Do you have a degree in any property-related discipline? How about at least three years of experience in design, construction or project management? If yes, we’re keen to discuss with you.

An empowering colleague

In this role, you’ll work with people of different ranks and responsibilities—that is why the ideal candidate is expected to promote open, constructive and collaborative relations with superiors, subordinates, peers and clients. Likewise, you’ll strive to gain the respect of JLL staff, clients and the broader business community.

What This Job Involves –

Providing a roadmap for success

Working with a team, you’ll set the vision for every project and enforce a process that helps everyone get to the finish line. This entails exploring stakeholders’ needs through conducting meetings with relevant parties (clients, consultants, contractors, agencies), as well as doing the necessary follow-through research and analysis. Afterward, you’ll get down to the project’s nitty gritty—such as the corresponding contract, cost, schedule, and health and safety requirements. And then you’ll proceed to creating the execution plan that ensures delivery of outputs to the stakeholders’ expectations and meets our own commercial objectives.

While formulating strategies that will lead to the project’s success, you’ll also closely manage the team and keep track of the project’s progress—from concept design, design development, construction documents, as-build drawings, and handing over of documents. Likewise, you’ll be expected to light the way during construction, and review all pending issues with the project team. You’ll need to collaborate effectively with a range of stakeholders, leading from the front while also taking the time to understand their point of view.

Of course, as you represent our clients’ best interests, you’ll also keep in mind JLL’s own business needs—and, thereby, strive to achieve an ideal balance between the two.

Manning people and operations

You’ll lead by example by showing your team that you’re a confident and proactive leader. You’ll need to establish a dynamic environment that promotes the sharing of ideas and employee growth, upholds the firm’s values and culture, and aligns with our purpose of shaping the future of real estate for a better world.

Core to our reputation is our strong focus on health & safety and on sustainability, and you’ll be expected to keep these front-of-mind at all times.

On a weekly basis, you’ll sit down with clients, consultants, contractors and agencies to review the progress of a project. You’ll also review project status reports during each operational phase and hold a project control group meeting. Creating project monthly and weekly status reports as well as project risk register, and HS reports is also on you. In the case of exceptions and remediations, you’ll need to report them, as necessary. As needed, you—together with the business development manager and other resources —will also prepare proposals, case studies, presentations and lessons learned.

To apply you need to be: –

Degree in Accounting or relevant professional accountancy qualification
8+ years of accounting experience in a corporate environment; with a minimum of 2 years of supervisory experience
This position must be able to interact effectively with both the internal and external client teams daily, especially Facility Managers, Project Managers, Finance staff and vendors

Performance objectives

The A/P Supervisor will be responsible for accounts payable activities in a high volume, energized environment
This position will be completely responsible for Finance operations and will also have complete responsibility for directly working with the business, quality team to ensure continuous performance improvement and sharing best practices within the team and across functions

Fulfil agreed SLAs with Onshore finance teams
Improved internal procedures and compliance with policies

Major challenges
To take the complexity of the regulations on the one hand, and the diversity of business and geographies within India, and achieve a balance between the demands of the regulators, external bodies and governmental initiatives and the Group’s shareholders and customers; being alive to the political, management, operational, regulatory and reputational implications of particular decisions and courses of action; assisting senior management in development of controls and systems and influencing the way in which business is conducted in order to manage these risks.
In order to effectively manage change in a volatile environment, the jobholder is required to have a broad and deep understanding of businesses, regulatory and industry issues, as well as the competitive landscape. The incumbent will be required to stay abreast of the rapidly changing regulatory environment as it relates to Financial Crime Compliance and the more stringent regulatory interface and intervention across multiple jurisdictions, which is complicated further given the dynamic nature and differing pace of change.
The incumbent is required to ensure the consistent application of the highest Risk management standards notwithstanding the complexities of products and business operations in India. Risk is forward looking. The incumbent would implement and drive change programmes to ensure that IR-FCI remains in line with regulatory requirements across India. A balance must be maintained between the local, regional and global priorities. The incumbent would need to balance between sometimes conflicting needs and priorities of different teams within Risk departments and across countries.
Role Context
India is an emerging economy and a strategic priority for the Group. It is a developing regulatory jurisdiction, which is regulated by multiple regulators not only within India (e.g. FIU-India, RBI, SEBI) but also from overseas (i.e. HKMA). While the regulations are voluminous and complex; sometimes prescriptive; sometimes ambiguous and sometimes archaic, the operating environment on the other hand is dynamic, demanding and diverse with multiple stakeholders.
The RBI primarily regulates the Bank’s business in India. Its regulations are complex requiring interpretation and subject to frequent amendments and clarification. RBI is increasingly delegating the monitoring of its policies and regulations to banks and accordingly the observance of directives/guidelines is now generally the responsibility of banks which increases the inherent risks. For example, the recent guidelines on risk based supervision has increased the pressure on the Compliance function. Whilst foreign exchange regulations have been relaxed, greater responsibilities have been placed upon banks to ensure that the revised guidelines are implemented.
Over the last few years, the Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU-IND) has also been interacting very closely with the banking industry and has been recommending implementation of a risk based framework, improving the mechanism for reporting, improving AML systems for capturing various AML red flag indicators etc. This adds to the challenge to the role as the role holder would be primarily responsible for driving the implementation of these changes within India.

About BRISTOL INDIA

Facebook page

We are a manufacturer of ECG papers used in the ECG machine.

BRISTOL INDIA was started in the year 1972 by two brothers; one was a technocrat and the other an able administrator. Both started with ink-writing papers used by powerhouses, fertilizer plants, and steel plants in their central control panels. Later on, we realized that time has come to enter a field where thermal paper is used since the ink-writing era was phasing out. Therefore, we imported a french plant in the year 1984 to start manufacturing TMT papers, or as you call it, ECG papers on thermal base paper.

This is to introduce ourselves as a pioneer and one of the largest manufacturers of more than 400 varieties of TMT, ECG, CTG, etc. in India.
